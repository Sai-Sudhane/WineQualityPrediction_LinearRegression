# WineQualityPrediction_LinearRegression
Overview
This project is an implementation of a wine quality prediction model using multiple linear regression. It aims to predict the quality of wines based on various attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar, and more. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and it contains information about red and white wines.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:

Dataset Name: Wine Quality Data
Dataset Source: Kaggle Wine Quality Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality/data)
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset file, typically named winequality.csv, used for training and testing the model.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, and model development.

models: Once the linear regression model is trained, it is saved in this directory for future use.

src: This directory contains source code and scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


Usage
Data Preparation: Place the dataset file (e.g., winequalityN.csv) in the data directory.

Data Preprocessing: Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to explore and preprocess the data. This may include handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.

Model Training: Use the scripts in the src directory to train a linear regression model on the preprocessed data. This includes splitting the data into training and testing sets and fitting the model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2).

Model Deployment (Optional): If desired, deploy the trained model in a real-world application for making wine quality predictions.

Results
The model's performance and evaluation results are documented in the Jupyter notebooks within the notebooks directory. You can find detailed analysis and visualizations of the predictions.
